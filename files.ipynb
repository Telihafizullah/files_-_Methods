    "# Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode\n",
    "# of file opening.\n",
    "#  The function used to open a file is called \"open()\" and it takes the filename and the mode as arguments; the different modes for opening \n",
    "#  a file include: \"r\" for reading, \"w\" for writing, \"a\" for appending, and combinations like \"r+\" for both reading and writing to a file\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "# The close() function is used to explicitly tell the operating system that a file is no longer needed, releasing the system resources \n",
    "# associated with that open file; this is crucial because failing to close a file can lead to data loss, corruption, and potential issues \n",
    "# with exceeding the system's limit on open files simultaneously\n",

    "    print(content)\n",

    "# Reads a single line from a file.\n",
    "# Returns the line as a string, including the newline character (\\n).\n",

    "\n",
    "# Reads all lines from a file and returns them as a list of strings.\n",
    "# Each element of the list represents a line from the file.\n",

    "# open() together?\n",
    "# The \"with\" statement is used with the \"open()\" function in Python to automatically close a file once you are finished using it\n",
    "# , eliminating the need to explicitly call the \"close()\" method, thus preventing potential errors that could occur if you forget to\n",
    "# close the file manually, especially in situations where exceptions might be raised; this makes your code cleaner and more reliable.\n",

    "# The `Write` method is used to write text to the console without adding a newline character at the end of the text. \n",
    "# The `WriteLine` method is used to write text to the console and adds a newline character at the end of the text, causing the next \n",
